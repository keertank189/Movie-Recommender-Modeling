# MovieRecommender Modeling
## Introduction
Movies are one of the oldest forms of entertainment. Recent trends have seen a massive shift in the way this form of media is consumed. Concomitant with the exploding use of smartphones and the internet, the consumption of digital media has also seen a meteoric rise. 
The consumption of digital movies on platforms such as Netflix, Prime Video etc has undergone a similarly booming usage pattern. However, until recently, recommendations of movies were based on word of mouth. While this did work reasonably well, there is also a possibility that movies that a certain user may immensely enjoy, might go unrecommended. Additionally, every user's taste, while possibly similar to other users' tastes, might be subtly different. 
Our project aims to overcome these shortcomings by automating the movie recommendation system process, along with the ability to be able to watch the recommended movies. 
The end users of our system are :
●	Streaming service subscribers
●	People looking for a movie to watch 

### Functional requirements
General : All the users should be able to log in, be able to receive recommendations for movies that the system thinks that they might be interested in, and be able to watch the movies.
End User Requirements : 
The end users include streaming service subscribers, or people looking for a movie to watch.
These users will have to register themselves, using an email id, or a phone number. Then these users will be presented with recommendations for possible movies to watch. They can then choose a movie from a list, and stream this movie.
End users should be able to : 
1.	Register as a new user

2.	Log-in using credentials

3.	Search for a movie to watch

4.	Get a movie recommendation

5.	Watch their selected movie

End-users should also be able to rate every movie that they have watched.

### Administrator Requirements :
The administrator should be able to : 
1.	Monitor users

2.	Monitor the health of the databases

3.	Be aware of the bandwidth consumption requirements for a given time


### Non-functional requirements
1.	The service should be available to all users through a generic client software like a web browser. 

2.	The administrators will use a thick client. 

3.	Recommendations should be cogent and relevant to the user. 

4.	Each user should not be able to access any other user's data. 

5.	Streaming service should ensure good quality of videos for users, yet allow all users to stream videos concurrently.
 
6.	The service must be reliable, and have an up time of 99.99%
